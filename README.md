# Navigation Demo in Flutter

This is a demo app that shows how to implement a bottom navigation bar with models that can be accessed and modified
by different pages through riverpod providers

It started as an adaptation from the tutorial in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoKqQjSDZ60, 
but it was enriched with:

- Theme
- Form validation and submission - inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5hJIKCTrvk and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rn3XbBijy4
- Riverpod
- Navigation in a list
